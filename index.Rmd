## Bio

I am a Master's Student at the State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry in [Dr. Colin Beier's lab](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/beier/index.php) studying forest disturbance detection algorithms and their applications in the forestry sector. I live in the Southern Adirondacks, where in my free time you can find me reading, knitting and paddling small boats.
