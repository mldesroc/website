## Bio

I've just wrapped up my Masters at the State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry in [Dr. Colin Beier's lab](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/beier/index.php) where I leveraged by experience with the forestry industry and my ecology background to study forest disturbance detection algorithms and their applications in the forestry sector. I now live in the Southern Adirondacks, where in my free time you can find me reading, knitting and paddling small boats.
